# Installing QMK on Royal Kludge RK 837 (G68)
This guide will walk you through on installing QMK on a Royal Kludge RK 837 RGB keyboard. Even though repos exist for other models and the white backlit version, this guide will only cover the RK 837 model with a SN32F24x MCU.

**There is a small chance that you may brick your keyboard in the flashing process, continue at your own risk. Use an appropriate cable, make sure you wonâ€™t lose power during flashing and follow the steps carefully.**

**SonixQMK in its current incarnation does not support Bluetooth or very fancy RGB effects and flashing your keyboard will disable the bluetooth entirely.**

This guide will have instructions to build and flash SonixQMK on RK 837.

I have not tried reverting to the original firmware after flashing SonixQMK, so this guide may be a one way road - Try it at your own risk.

This guide assumes that you have the stock bootloader and not Sonix Jumploader.

#TODO
1. Clone a rk61 port and analyze
2. Analyze RK68 matrix
